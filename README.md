# Blog_app_flask
This is a blog app using Flask.

Hello peeps!!!!
So this is my first project on backend web development. I have used Flask for developing the backend, and other styling techniques like Bootsrap and CSS for the frontend.

So do give a look into my blog web app.

And one tip!!
To run the app, run a command prompt on the main directory and type 'python run.py'. Note the IP adress with the port number form the command prompt. Open a web browser and rin that IP with the port.
Congrats!! You are now viewing my app!!!
